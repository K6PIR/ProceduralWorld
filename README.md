# ProceduralWorld

Based on youtube tutorial made by Sebastian Lague, I worked on a procedural world.
With this project I could work on procedural generation and on multi-threading process.

## Usage

Open the folder ProceduralWorld inside the repository with UNITY to use it.
If you want to play, just build a version with UNITY.
